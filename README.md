Thunderhead
===========

Python-based cloud client, initially for the [Rackspace Cloud][rsc], potentially expanding
to other providers depending on how things go.

This is in its infancy and is currently rather like a newborn utterly lacking in
cognitive function.  But it should become functional shortly.

### Requirements

Thunderhead is implemented in and requires Python.

Care has been and will be taken to keep dependencies modest.  Consequently, no Python tools
are required outside the standard library.

At the moment, targeting Python 2.4 as the minimal version, and not 3.0-compliant.

The unit tests require a fork-friendly operating system.  This should not affect normal
(non-test) operations.
